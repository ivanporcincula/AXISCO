# AXISCO

  With the rise of e-commerce in the Philippines, coupled with the demand for computers,
this project takes advantage of the knowledge gained from the course and applies it to an
e-commerce PC parts and accessories shop named AxisCo. The website contains laptops,
processors, GPUs, cooling solutions, motherboards, CPU cases, power supply units, RAM,
storage, headsets, speakers, mouses, keyboards, and monitors.

  The project utilizes and implements the following concepts that have been discussed in
the duration of the course; HTML or Hypertext markup language which is a formatting system of
data from the internet (Hemmendinger, 2020). CSS or Cascading Style Sheets which is a simple
mechanism for controlling the style of a Web document without compromising its structure and
allows you to separate visual design elements (layout, fonts, colors, margins, etc.) from the
contents of a Web page. JavaScript which is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
programming language with first-class functions.
